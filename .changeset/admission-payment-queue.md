The treasurer works admission payments from a payment queue: `GET /admissions/payments` (tabs Menunggu, Terverifikasi, Ditolak with counts), `PATCH /admissions/payments/:applicationId/verify`, `POST /admissions/payments/:applicationId/cancel` (reason required, allowed until the application is decided), `POST /admissions/payments` (add a verified payment for an applicant, proof required) and `GET /admissions/payments/eligible-applications`, guarded by the new `admission-payments.read|verify|create` permissions. The existing payment verification endpoint is now guarded by `admission-payments.verify`. `TREASURER` holds the three permissions and no longer `admissions.verify`.
