Admins manage admission document types: `GET|POST /admissions/document-types`, `PATCH|DELETE /admissions/document-types/:id` and `PUT /admissions/document-types/order`, guarded by the new `admission-document-types.*` permissions (admission admins and operators manage them, student-affairs staff read them). A type's code is generated from its name and never changes; a used type can only be deactivated. The admin application read keeps an inactive type the application has uploaded.
