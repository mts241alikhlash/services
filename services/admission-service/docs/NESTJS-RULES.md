# DOMAIN STRUCTURE

platform

academic

inventory

admission

Each domain owns (actual layering):

- presentation (controllers — thin, HTTP only)
- use-cases (one class per business operation)
- domain (entities, enums, interfaces, exceptions)
    interfaces/ holds the abstract repository = the port AND the DI token
- infrastructure (persistence: Prisma impl + *.includes.ts; mappers; parsers)
- dto (request/ and response/ — one DTO per file)
- types, constants

There is no top-level `repositories/` folder. The port lives in
`domain/interfaces/`, its Prisma implementation in `infrastructure/persistence/`,
and the module wires them together:

providers: [{ provide: IStudentRepository, useClass: PrismaStudentRepository }]

# FORBIDDEN STRUCTURE

src

controllers

services

repositories

dto

shared globally

Never organize by technical layer.

Always organize by domain.

---

# CONTROLLER RULES

Controller responsibility:

- receive request
- validate request
- call the use case
- return response

Nothing else.

---

# CONTROLLER FORBIDDEN

Business logic

Database query

Complex mapping

Permission logic

Validation logic

---

# USE CASE RULES

The use-case owns the business logic. `academic/` names them `*UseCase`, not
`*Service` — `services/` is reserved for the few stateless helpers that are not
a business operation (e.g. `report-card/services/calculate-subject-grades.ts`,
`pdf.service.ts`).

Examples of what belongs here:

Student promotion

Report card generation

Attendance validation

Assessment publication

---

One use case

One business responsibility

---

Bad

StudentService

3000 lines

handles everything

---

Good

CreateStudentUseCase

UpdateStudentUseCase

PromoteStudentsUseCase

GenerateReportCardUseCase

---

A use-case may call another module's exported use-case directly (see EVENT
RULES). It must never call a controller, and never touch Prisma.

---

# USE CASE SIZE

Recommended

50-150 lines

Review

200+ lines

# REPOSITORY RULES

Repository owns:

Database access only

---

Repository must never contain:

Business logic

Permission logic

Validation logic

---

Allowed

findById()

findMany()

create()

update()

delete()

---

# PRISMA RULES

All Prisma access must go through repository layer.

Forbidden

Controller → Prisma

Use Case → Prisma

---

Required

Controller

↓

Use Case          (injected as IXxxRepository, never the Prisma class)

↓

Repository        (the port; Prisma impl bound in the module)

↓

Prisma

---

The use-case depends on the ABSTRACTION. That inversion is what lets 1200+
tests run without a database — swap `useClass` and nothing above it changes.

---

# DTO RULES

One DTO per file.

Split by direction into subfolders:

dto/request/   (create / update / query)

dto/response/  (response DTOs)

---

Allowed

dto/request/create-student.dto.ts

dto/request/update-student.dto.ts   (UpdateDto = PartialType of the Create DTO,
unless a field set is intentionally restricted, e.g. immutable code/FK excluded)

dto/request/student-query.dto.ts

dto/response/student-response.dto.ts

---

Forbidden

20 DTOs in one file

A response DTO living under dto/request/ (or vice versa)

---

## Read only the fields the caller shows

A `Profile` holds sixteen columns, most of them identifying. Reading the whole
record to draw a name carries all of it out of the database on every row of
every list, and silently adds any column defined later to every screen at once.

**Every read that reaches a profile uses one of three shapes** from
`shared/domain/prisma-selects.ts`. `profile: true`, or an inline profile select,
is a defect.

| Situation | Shape |
|---|---|
| A person appears as a label | `PROFILE_NAME_SELECT` |
| A person's picture is drawn | `PROFILE_DISPLAY_SELECT` |
| Student, teacher or enrolment list | `PROFILE_ROSTER_SELECT` |
| A spreadsheet export or the profile screen | Its own explicit select, at the call site, with a comment |

Each shape carries `satisfies Prisma.ProfileDefaultArgs`, so a field that does
not exist fails to compile. Widening a shape reaches every caller — add the
field at the call site instead.

**The domain row must be as narrow as the query.** `ProfileNameRef`,
`ProfileDisplayRef` and `ProfileRosterRef` mirror the three shapes;
`UserRef<TProfile>` and `PersonRef<TProfile>` take the projection as a
parameter, defaulting to the name.

> **A row that types its fields as optional cannot catch a narrowing.** This has
> already cost a bug: the student list narrowed to three fields, the spreadsheet
> export shared its query, and because `StudentWithDetails` typed birth place,
> birth date, email and phone as optional, it compiled and would have written
> four empty columns. A read whose fields must be present types them as
> **required** — see `StudentExportWithDetails`.

### Reaching a person *through their account*

Narrowing the profile is only half of it. Prisma's `include` means "these
relations **as well as** every scalar column I own", so this reads like a
narrowed query and is not one:

```ts
user: { include: { profile: PROFILE_NAME_SELECT } } // every column of User
```

`User` owns `passwordHash`. Combined with a use case that returns what the
repository handed it, that shape answered a student's own profile request with
their homeroom teacher's bcrypt hash. Neither half was wrong alone.

So a user relation is reached with `USER_REF_SELECT`, `USER_DISPLAY_SELECT` or
`USER_ROSTER_SELECT` — id, identifier, isActive, and the matching profile.
`user: true` and `user: { include: … }` are both defects, and
`no-user-scalar-overfetch.spec.ts` fails the build on either. It strips comments
first, so a file may name the shape it warns against.

The same reasoning applies to any model holding a secret: prefer `select` over
`include` at the point where one is reached.

Two more habits the same rule implies:

- **A list and a detail read differently.** Aliasing them (`LIST = DETAIL`) means
  the list page fetches whatever the detail screen needs.
- **A bare `true` on a relation pulls every column.** Select what the domain row
  declares. On a to-one relation Prisma takes no `where`, so soft-deleted rows
  cannot be filtered in the include — select `deletedAt` and let the caller check.

---

## Reading your own record: a separate permission, a separate route

A read that answers about the person asking is not a narrowed version of the
read that answers about everyone. It is a different endpoint with a different
permission, and the difference is what makes a role's grants legible: you can
tell what a role may see by reading its permissions, without opening a use case
to look for a conditional.

```
report-cards.read        GET /rapors        every student's
report-cards.read-own    GET /rapors/me     the caller's own
```

Four rules, each of which has already been got wrong here at least once.

**The caller's identity is applied after their query, never before.**

```ts
// right — a supplied studentId cannot win
return this.getReportCards.execute(query, { studentId: resolved });

// wrong — `?studentId=<someone else>` overrides the caller
return this.getReportCards.execute({ studentId: resolved, ...query });
```

The wrong version returns a correctly formatted list of report cards belonging
to the wrong person, which is indistinguishable on screen from the right one.

**Where the scope lands matters as much as when.** If a where-builder rewrites
a relation object wholesale for some other filter, a scope merged into that
object is erased by a query parameter. Put it in `AND`, which nothing the caller
sends can reach — `prisma-attendance.where.ts` carries the note.

**No student record means an empty result, returned explicitly.** A null that
falls through into an unfiltered read widens it to everyone, silently.

**A cohort-shaped read is refused, not narrowed.** A recap or a trend describes
a group; answering one to a self-service caller hands them a summary of other
people without disclosing a single row. Their own figures come from their own
rows instead.

Two mechanics: declare `.../me` **before** its `:id` sibling or Nest parses `me`
as a uuid, and never put the subject on the DTO — a field on a DTO is a field a
caller can send. It is a use-case argument.

If a route does not use the caller, it must not ask for them. A parameter named
`_user` records a decision to ignore identity, and a reader skims past a
decision; `no-ignored-caller.spec.ts` enforces the absence.

---

## Language: the backend is written in English

Exception and validation messages, Swagger summaries and descriptions, log
lines, field and class names, and comments are all English. Indonesian is the
frontend's job: it owns presentation, and it can turn an English message or
code into whatever the screen should say. A field is `passingScore`, never
`kkm`.

Exempt, on one principle — text that leaves the system as the final thing a
person reads, with nothing in between to translate it:

- **Rendered documents.** `report-card-pdf.template.ts` prints the rapor a
  parent receives. The student import/export column headers are the contract
  with a spreadsheet the TU already fills in; renaming them breaks their file.
- **Messages delivered to a person.** Password-reset email bodies, and the
  admission notification titles and bodies, which are stored and shown verbatim
  to the applicant.
- **Seed data** under `prisma/seeds/` — subject names, positions and holidays
  are real school data, not interface text.

Anything else reading as Indonesian under `src/` is a bug.

---

## `*Dto` vs `*Input` — two boundaries, not two styles

Both exist on purpose. They are not interchangeable and neither replaces
the other.

| | `*Dto` | `*Input` |
|---|---|---|
| Boundary | HTTP (presentation) | domain port (repository) |
| Form | class + class-validator + Swagger | plain interface, no decorators |
| Lives in | `dto/request/`, `dto/response/` | `domain/interfaces/<x>-repository.interface.ts` |
| Answers | what the wire accepts | what persistence needs |

The flow is layered:

```
HTTP body
  -> CreateSubjectDto              dto/request/        (validated here)
  -> use case                      use-cases/
  -> CreateSubjectRepositoryInput  domain/interfaces/  (framework-free)
  -> Prisma
```

If a repository took the DTO, class-validator and Swagger — both HTTP
concerns — would sit behind a port that must stay transport-agnostic, and
the repository could no longer be driven from a CLI, a scheduled job, or
a test without dragging the HTTP layer in. `shared/domain/interfaces/
repository.interface.ts` states the same reason for `PaginationQueryInput`.

Naming: `*QueryInput` for reads, `*RepositoryInput` for writes,
`<Operation>Input` for a specific operation.

---

## Map the DTO to the Input explicitly

Forbidden — forwarding the whole DTO:

```ts
await this.subjectRepository.create(dto);
```

TypeScript is structural, so this compiles whenever the shapes happen to
line up. The cost is that a field added to the DTO later reaches
persistence with nobody deciding it should. That is precisely how
`teacherIds` entered the subject write path and began assigning one
teacher to every classroom.

Required — field by field:

```ts
await this.subjectRepository.create({
  code: dto.code,
  name: dto.name,
});
```

Note this is a review-time rule, not a test-enforced one: an existing spec
asserting `toHaveBeenCalledWith(dto)` stays green either way, because the
mapped object is structurally equal to the DTO.

---

# VALIDATION RULES

Use:

class-validator

class-transformer

---

Validation only inside DTO.

---

Forbidden

if (!name)

inside a use case

---

# NO INLINE TYPES

Forbidden

interface StudentData

inside a use-case or controller

---

Use

types/ · domain/entities/ · domain/interfaces/

A repository's input and result shapes belong next to the port they serve, in
`domain/interfaces/<x>-repository.interface.ts`.

---

Also forbidden: repeating an object literal in a signature.

Bad — this exact shape was copy-pasted across 27 files

async findAll(...): Promise<{
  data: StudentWithDetails[];
  meta: { page: number; limit: number; total: number; totalPages: number };
}>

Good

async findAll(...): Promise<PaginatedResponse<StudentWithDetails>>

---

Narrow projections in a signature are FINE and should stay inline:

Promise<{ id: string } | null>      an id-only lookup

Promise<{ count: number }>          a Prisma BatchPayload

Naming those adds a hop without adding meaning. The rule targets duplicated or
domain-bearing shapes, not every brace.

---

# NO INLINE CONSTANTS

Forbidden

status = "ACTIVE"

role = "ADMIN"

inside a use case

---

Use

constants/

student.constants.ts

role.constants.ts

---

# SCOPING RULES

The deployment is single-school. There is no `organizationId`, and
`schoolUnitId` exists only on `Address` and a couple of platform models — the
academic domain does not filter by it anywhere. Do not add a tenant filter that
the schema cannot honour.

What every academic query MUST scope by instead:

---

1. Soft delete

deletedAt: null

Non-negotiable. Nearly every academic table is soft-deleted, so a query without
it silently returns removed students, classes, and scores.

---

2. Period, wherever the row belongs to one

semesterId — enrolments, teaching assignments, supervisors

academicYearId — classrooms, curricula, semesters

When the caller gives neither, resolve the ACTIVE semester rather than reading
across every year (see `shared/utils/active-academic-year.helper.ts`).

---

Forbidden

findMany() with no deletedAt filter

An unbounded list read that ignores the active period

---

A second school is a second deployment of these repositories against its own
database — not a tenant column added here. Nothing in this section changes to
serve one.

---

# AUTHORIZATION RULES

Never check role names.

Forbidden

user.role === "ADMIN"

---

Good

@RequirePermissions('students.create')

Codes are `<module>.<action>`, and the module segment is PLURAL — `students`,
`schedules`, `report-cards`. The full list lives in
`platform/access-control/permission/constants/permission-codes.constants.ts`.

There is no `permissionService.has(...)` helper; the guard below is the only
enforcement point.

---

# AUTHORIZATION ENFORCEMENT

Authorization is permission-based, enforced at the controller via the
`@RequirePermissions(...)` decorator + guard — not per-module policy files.

Example

@RequirePermissions('students.create')

@RequirePermissions('students.read')

@RequirePermissions('students.update')

@RequirePermissions('students.delete')

---

Permission strings, roles, and their design live in `IAM.md`.

---

# MAPPER RULES

Never let a raw Prisma row reach the client untyped.

In practice the shape is pinned at the query, not by a mapper class: each
repository declares its `include` once in a `*.includes.ts` file and derives the
return type from it.

Example (`prisma-student.includes.ts`)

export const STUDENT_INCLUDE = { ... } satisfies Prisma.StudentInclude

export type StudentWithDetails =
  Prisma.StudentGetPayload<{ include: typeof STUDENT_INCLUDE }>

---

Reach for a dedicated mapper under `infrastructure/mappers/` only when the
outward shape genuinely differs from the row — renamed or computed fields,
flattened relations. Today only `student` and `semester` need one.

---

The controller's declared return type is the real contract. Every list endpoint
returns `PaginatedResponse<T>`; every detail endpoint returns an explicit
entity or response DTO. Never `any`, never an inline object literal.

---

# ENTITY RULES

Entity represents domain.

Not database.

---

Example

StudentEntity

TeacherEntity

AssessmentEntity

---

# SHARED RULES

shared contains only:

helpers

types

enums

constants

utils

---

Shared must not contain:

business logic

---

# EVENT RULES

This codebase does NOT use domain events. `@nestjs/event-emitter` is not a
dependency, and nothing emits or listens.

Default: a direct, awaited call into the other module's exported use-case.

---

Why (ADR-0002)

`student.created` used to be emitted after creating a student with a classroom,
with `EnrollmentModule` listening. `EventEmitter2.emit()` is never awaited, so a
failed enrolment was only logged — the API had already answered "created". It
was replaced by an awaited call to `EnsureStudentEnrollmentUseCase`, and the
event + listener were deleted.

---

Rule of thumb

ONE business rule → ONE must-succeed consequence
  = direct awaited call, so the error reaches the caller

ONE fact → MANY independent subscribers
  = a genuine event; reintroduce the emitter when that case actually appears

---

Loose coupling is not the goal. Correct data is. A module boundary that hides
failures is worse than a compile-time dependency.

No `events/` folder and no `*.events.ts` file remains anywhere in `src/`. If one
reappears, it should come with an emitter, a subscriber, and the dependency —
not on its own.

---

# RESPONSE RULES

Controllers return plain payloads. The global `ResponseInterceptor`
(`core/interceptors/response.interceptor.ts`) wraps every one of them — never
build the envelope by hand.

Actual shape

{
statusCode: 200,
message: "Success",
data: {},
meta?: {}
}

There is no `success` field. The status code carries that.

---

Pagination

Repositories return the flat shape:

{ data: [], total, page, limit }

The interceptor detects it and folds it into `data` + `meta`. A use-case that
computes `totalPages` returns `PaginatedResponse<T>` instead, and the
interceptor passes it through untouched.

---

Use the shared types — do not re-declare the envelope inline:

shared/domain/interfaces/repository.interface.ts

  PaginatedResult<T>    repository side  { data, total, page, limit }

  PaginatedResponse<T>  HTTP side        { data, meta }

  PaginationMeta                         { page, limit, total, totalPages }

Response DTOs must import `PaginationMeta` with `import type` — it sits under a
Swagger decorator, and `isolatedModules` + `emitDecoratorMetadata` reject a
value import there.

---

StreamableFile responses (Excel export, report-card PDF) bypass the envelope.

---

# FILE SIZE RULES

The budget counts CODE. Import blocks and `@Api*` Swagger decorators do not
count against it — they are documentation, and a well-documented controller
routinely reaches ~190 physical lines while every handler body is one line.

Use case / service     max 300 lines

Repository class       max 200 lines

Any other file         max 300 lines

Controller             max 150 lines of code
                       (physical length is dominated by Swagger; judge the
                        handler bodies, not `wc -l`)

---

# SPLITTING A REPOSITORY

When a Prisma repository outgrows 200 lines, do NOT split the class or the
interface it implements. Move the details out into sibling files and leave the
class as a flat map of contract method → one call:

*.includes.ts    Prisma include/select objects + the derived payload type

*.where.ts       where-clause builders shared by list and export queries

*.queries.ts     multi-step or grouped reads

*.writer.ts      multi-table writes taking a `Prisma.TransactionClient`

*.steps.ts       one function per stage of a long transaction
                 (see prisma-rollover.steps.ts, prisma-promotion.steps.ts)

---

If it still does not fit, the contract itself is too fat — that is an Interface
Segregation problem, not a formatting one.

`IScheduleRepository` had 18 methods, six of which reached outside the Schedule
aggregate (resolve a classroom, find the active semester, create a teaching
assignment). Those moved to `IScheduleLookupRepository`, and both adapters came
in comfortably under the limit. Splitting the port is the correct fix; padding
the file is not.

---

# IMPORT RULES

Backend is NodeNext ESM. No path aliases — use relative imports, and every
relative import MUST carry the `.js` extension (source is `.ts`).

Allowed

import { AppModule } from './app.module.js'

import { StudentRepository } from '../repositories/student.repository.js'

---

# BARREL & MODULE IMPORT RULES

A feature's `index.ts` barrel = its PUBLIC API (DTOs, tokens, use-cases, guards)
for outside consumers.

NestJS Module classes:
import via `x.module.js` DIRECTLY — never through a barrel.

Cross-module DTO → DTO:
import the DTO FILE directly — never through the other feature's barrel.

Why:
a feature barrel also re-exports runtime-heavy symbols (its Module, use-cases,
repositories). A lightweight DTO importing that barrel drags the whole graph in
and closes an ESM import cycle, crashing boot with:

"Nest cannot create the <X>Module instance.
 The module at index [0] of the imports array is undefined."

(Official NestJS: barrel files must be omitted when importing module or provider
classes — https://docs.nestjs.com/faq/common-errors)

Bad

// role-response.dto.ts
import { PermissionResponseDto } from '../../../permissions/index.js'

Good

// role-response.dto.ts
import { PermissionResponseDto }
  from '../../../permissions/dto/response/permission-response.dto.js'

For a genuine mutual module/provider dependency, use forwardRef() on both sides.

---

# ERROR HANDLING

Throw NestJS HTTP exceptions from the use-case layer. They carry the right
status code and are picked up by the global `HttpExceptionFilter`.

Default vocabulary

NotFoundException

ConflictException

BadRequestException

ForbiddenException

---

Forbidden

throw new Error()

A bare `Error` becomes an opaque 500. If a failure really is an unexpected
invariant violation, say so with `InternalServerErrorException` (or a custom
exception extending it) so the intent is on the page.

---

Custom exceptions are OPTIONAL, and always extend a built-in.

Add one when a rule is thrown from several call sites and deserves a domain
name — not for every throw. `academic/student/domain/exceptions/` is the
reference implementation:

StudentNotFoundException            extends NotFoundException

StudentNisAlreadyExistsException    extends ConflictException

StudentCreationFailedException      extends InternalServerErrorException

---

Because they extend the built-ins, the HTTP contract does not change and tests
asserting `rejects.toThrow(NotFoundException)` keep passing. That is the point:
a custom exception adds a NAME, never new transport behaviour.

One file per exception, under the owning module's `domain/exceptions/`, plus an
`index.ts` barrel (exceptions only — no Module, no use-case).

---

# TRANSACTION RULES

Use a Prisma transaction when several writes inside ONE module must land
together:

Student promotion / semester rollover  (classrooms → enrolments → schedules)

Account provisioning  (User + Profile + Student/Teacher)

Bulk score import, bulk attendance

Soft-deleting a student  (student row + its user account)

---

Do NOT wrap a sequence that crosses a module boundary (ADR-0003).

Student → Enrollment writes are deliberately left untransacted:

- Prisma's own guidance is to keep interactive transactions short and free of
  branching; `EnsureStudentEnrollmentUseCase` alone is a find → decide →
  create-or-transfer chain.
- They are separate aggregates in separate modules. DDD asks for immediate
  consistency inside an aggregate, eventual consistency between them.
- Every step is idempotent, and the failure already surfaces in the bulk-import
  row's `errors[]` rather than being swallowed.

Reach for a transaction because the writes are same-module and NOT safe to
retry — not because "multiple writes" pattern-matches a database habit.

---

# AUDIT RULES

STATUS: infrastructure only. NOT yet wired into `academic/`.

What exists

`AuditLog` model (`prisma/iam.prisma`) — actor, action, resource, resourceId,
metadata, ipAddress, userAgent

`platform/audit-log/` — repository, `CreateAuditLogUseCase`, and a read
endpoint behind `audit-logs.read`

What does not exist

Zero calls from `academic/`. No student create, grade change, or report-card
publish currently writes an audit row.

---

Do not describe auditing as if it were enforced. When it is wired up, the
target list is:

Create · Update · Delete · Publish · Approve

with report-card publish and grade changes first — those are the records a
school is actually asked to account for.

---

# MODULE DEPENDENCY RULES

Domains: platform, academic, inventory, admission.

Platform

may be used by everyone (supplier)

---

academic / inventory / admission

may consume platform, but must not reach into each other's internals

---

Cross-domain access only through a module's public API (its barrel / exported
tokens / domain events) — never deep-import another domain's internals.

---

# FORBIDDEN

Business logic in controller

Prisma in controller

Prisma in use case

Role checking by string

Cross-domain direct access

Global god service/use case

5000 line use case

Any type

Magic strings

Magic numbers

Direct entity exposure

Unscoped query (missing `deletedAt` or active-period filter — see SCOPING
RULES; this deployment is single-school and has no tenant column to check)

---

# SUCCESS CRITERIA

A feature can be removed without breaking another feature.

A domain can evolve independently.

A future microservice extraction is possible.

Every query is scoped — soft delete, and the active period. (This deployment
is single-school; a second school is a second deployment, not a tenant column.)

Every action is permission controlled.

The codebase remains maintainable at 100+ modules and 500+ endpoints.
